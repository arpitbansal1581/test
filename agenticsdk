# 🧠 Architecture Decision Record (ADR) — Custom Agentic SDK Development

---

**ADR ID:** ADR-2025-AG-SDK-001
**Title:** Build and Adopt a Custom Agentic SDK for Intelligent Agent Development
**Status:** Approved
**Date:** 12-Nov-2025
**Author:** Platform Architecture Team

---

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

Our organization’s *Intelligent Automation and LLM Orchestration Framework (IB-Agentic Platform)* requires a unified, governable, and auditable SDK to build, manage, and evolve intelligent agents across regulatory, document processing, and decision-support workflows.

Current open-source and commercial SDKs — such as **LangGraph**, **OpenAI Agent SDK**, and various **vendor-provided orchestration frameworks** — offer useful abstractions for reasoning, state management, and tool invocation.
However, **none of them fully satisfy our enterprise-level IB requirements**, including:

* Regulatory and audit traceability across agent reasoning and action logs
* Secure integration with internal A2A communication and Azure Service Bus
* Tenant-aware multi-agent coordination with isolation and observability
* Dynamic compliance-driven routing and human-in-loop workflows
* Adaptive reinforcement and continuous improvement framework (beyond simple tool usage)
* Seamless integration with our internal governance, telemetry, and compliance layers

Hence, a **custom Agentic SDK** is required — one that incorporates the best concepts from LangGraph, OpenAI Agent SDK, and other available frameworks, while ensuring our IB architecture, security, and compliance requirements are fully met.

## 2. Decision Drivers

1. **Governance & Traceability:** Every agent action, state transition, and tool invocation must be traceable and reviewable.
2. **Observability:** Native support for logs, metrics, traces, and evaluation feedback loops.
3. **Security & Isolation:** Agents must operate within controlled sandboxes and communicate only through approved channels (e.g., Azure Service Bus, A2A connectors).
4. **Extensibility:** Ability to integrate new reasoning models, tools, and task planners dynamically.
5. **Compliance Alignment:** Must comply with regulatory reporting and audit standards.
6. **Interoperability:** Should leverage best patterns from existing SDKs (LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, Semantic Kernel, etc.) while removing their limitations.

## 3. Considered Alternatives

| **Option**                      | **Description**                                                                       | **Pros**                                                    | **Cons**                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LangGraph**                   | Open-source agentic workflow framework with stateful reasoning graphs.                | Visual graph structure, strong community, composable nodes. | Limited enterprise control, lacks native audit and governance support.     |
| **OpenAI Agent SDK**            | SDK for structured tool invocation and LLM-based function calling.                    | Well-integrated with OpenAI ecosystem, clean design.        | Closed ecosystem, lacks enterprise-level extensibility and observability.  |
| **Proprietary Vendor SDKs**     | Various private offerings from SaaS/LLM providers.                                    | Supported and production-tested.                            | Lack transparency, vendor lock-in, no deep customization for IB use cases. |
| **Custom In-House Agentic SDK** | Build an SDK leveraging best features from above while aligning with IB architecture. | Full control, tailored observability, and compliance.       | Requires development and maintenance effort.                               |

## 4. Decision

We will **develop a custom Agentic SDK** that:

* Adopts **graph-based reasoning and orchestration patterns** from LangGraph
* Integrates **structured tool invocation** and **contextual memory management** from OpenAI SDK
* Embeds **IB-native security, compliance, and traceability modules**
* Exposes **standardized APIs** for agent registration, task routing, and feedback ingestion
* Supports **plug-and-play connectors** for Azure Cognitive Search, Document Intelligence, and Cognitive Services
* Enables **continuous evaluation and adaptive learning loops**

The SDK will serve as a **core framework** in our agentic ecosystem, powering **domain-specific agents** for regulatory change management, document data extraction, and enterprise compliance workflows.

## 5. Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

* Full compliance with IB governance standards
* Centralized observability, audit, and evaluation control
* Extensible architecture for multi-agent collaboration
* Reduced vendor dependency
* Reusable building blocks for agent creation and deployment

### Negative Outcomes

* Increased development and maintenance effort
* Initial slower rollout compared to ready-made SDKs
* Continuous need for architectural alignment with evolving LLM technologies

---

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Core Components

* **Agent Lifecycle Manager** — registration, state management
* **Reasoning Graph Engine** — task orchestration, adaptive planning
* **Tool Invocation Layer** — A2A connectors, system tools, external APIs
* **Observation & Reinforcement Module** — evaluation, learning loops
* **Governance & Telemetry Layer** — traceability, compliance logging

### Technology Stack

* Python (LangGraph-inspired orchestration)
* Azure Service Bus for agent communication
* Azure Monitor + LangFuse for observability
* OpenAI + Azure Cognitive Services for reasoning and perception layers

### Future Enhancements

* Multi-modal tool adapters (Vision, Speech, PDF Intelligence)
* Self-improving agent memory and fine-tuning integration
* Federated agent collaboration across business domains

Would you like me to add a **Confluence decision header layout** (like a colored “Status: Approved” box and metadata panel at top)? It makes it look exactly like Atlassian’s built-in *Decision Record Template* pages.
