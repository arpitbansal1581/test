h1. ADR-023: Evaluation of Azure Project ARGUS for Document Data Retrieval and Contextual Understanding

*Date:* 12 Nov 2025  
*Status:* *Proposed*  
*Owner:* Platform Architecture & AI Enablement Team  
*Related ADRs:* ADR-012 (Document Intelligence Integration), ADR-018 (LLM-based Reasoning for Document Understanding), ADR-021 (Traceability & Evaluation Framework)

----

h2. 1. Context

The platform currently leverages *Azure Document Intelligence* for OCR and structured data extraction, and *Azure OpenAI* models for reasoning and summarization.

While this provides baseline document processing capabilities, the current setup lacks:

* Deep contextual understanding across document sections (e.g., relationships between clauses, tables, and metadata)
* Unified framework for evaluation, schema management, and dataset-specific extraction logic
* Scalable integration between layout extraction and semantic reasoning layers

Microsoft’s open-source project *[ARGUS|https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ARGUS]* claims to enhance contextual data retrieval and comprehension by combining Document Intelligence with LLM-based reasoning, configurable datasets, and evaluation modules.

This ADR evaluates whether adopting ARGUS (partially or fully) provides measurable benefits for the *Document Understanding and Retrieval Pipeline.*

----

h2. 2. Decision

We will *partially adopt the ARGUS architectural pattern* — integrating its hybrid pipeline concept and dataset configuration structure — while retaining our existing orchestration and observability frameworks.

*Adopt:*
# Hybrid extraction + reasoning pipeline (Document Intelligence + LLM reasoning)
# Dataset abstraction for configurable prompts, schemas, and evaluation logic
# Evaluation framework for semantic and fuzzy string similarity validation

*Not Adopt:*
# Direct use of ARGUS source code in production (due to limited enterprise support)
# Its orchestration layer (we will use LangGraph-based internal controller)
# Its storage and deployment model (outputs will integrate into Azure Cognitive Search and observability stack)

----

h2. 3. Rationale

|| Capability Area || Baseline (Doc Intelligence + LLM) || ARGUS Approach || Improvement ||
| *Extraction Accuracy* | Accurate for structured fields only | Combines layout parsing with reasoning | Better relational accuracy (linking totals, clauses, entities) |
| *Contextual Understanding* | Limited to prompt design | Context-aware extraction and reasoning | Stronger semantic linking between document sections |
| *Adaptability to Document Types* | Manual tuning per type | Dataset-based configuration (zero-shot) | Easier scaling across document domains |
| *Evaluation & Traceability* | Manual validation | Semantic and fuzzy-match evaluation | Quantifiable quality metrics |
| *Operational Scalability* | Script-driven | Cloud-native, event-driven | Compatible with Service Bus architecture |
| *Governance / Auditability* | Basic metadata logs | Schema-based lineage with source traceability | Supports regulatory audit needs |

ARGUS’s hybrid design enables richer contextual understanding by reasoning over structured outputs rather than plain text, offering *domain-specific, traceable, and evaluatable document intelligence*.

This aligns with our objectives for *traceability, adaptive learning, and agentic human-in-the-loop review.*

----

h2. 4. Consequences

h3. Positive Impacts
* Improved data retrieval precision and contextual accuracy
* Domain-specific and configurable extraction via datasets
* Stronger traceability: extracted values linked to document sources
* Built-in evaluation and quality metrics for ongoing monitoring
* Compatible with agentic workflow orchestration (LangGraph, Service Bus)

h3. Negative Impacts / Risks
* Increased computational cost (OCR + LLM reasoning stages)
* Prompt and schema governance overhead (versioning required)
* ARGUS maturity risk – open-source reference, not production framework
* Integration complexity with current observability and vector search layers

----

h2. 5. Decision Outcome

*Status:* ✅ *Approved for Pilot Integration*

The *Data Retrieval and Intelligence layer* will incorporate an ARGUS-inspired hybrid model.  
A proof-of-concept will benchmark:

* Extraction accuracy vs baseline (Precision, Recall, F1)
* Contextual Q&A response quality (semantic similarity)
* Processing throughput and Azure cost metrics

Pilot outcomes will determine final adoption into the production blueprint for *Regulatory, Contractual, and Financial Document Pipelines.*

----

h2. 6. Next Steps

# Deploy controlled pilot with 200 sample documents
# Compare retrieval metrics vs. current baseline
# Define governance standards for dataset schema management
# Integrate evaluation results into Observability Dashboard
# Submit final Implementation ADR post-pilot
