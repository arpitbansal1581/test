# **ADR-023: Evaluation of Azure Project ARGUS for Document Data Retrieval and Contextual Understanding**

**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** Platform Architecture & AI Enablement Team
**Related ADRs:** ADR-012 (Document Intelligence Integration), ADR-018 (LLM-based Reasoning for Document Understanding), ADR-021 (Traceability & Evaluation Framework)

---

## **Context**

The platform currently leverages **Azure Document Intelligence** for OCR and structured data extraction and **Azure OpenAI** models for reasoning and summarization.
While this architecture provides baseline document processing capabilities, it lacks:

* Deep contextual understanding across document elements (e.g., relationships between clauses, tables, and metadata).
* A unified framework for evaluation, prompt schema management, and dataset-specific extraction logic.
* Scalable integration between layout extraction and semantic reasoning layers.

Microsoft’s open-source initiative **[ARGUS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ARGUS)** claims to improve contextual data retrieval and comprehension by combining Document Intelligence with LLM-based reasoning, configurable datasets, and evaluation modules.
This ADR evaluates whether adopting ARGUS (partially or fully) provides measurable benefits for our **document understanding and retrieval pipeline**.

---

## **Decision**

We will **partially adopt the ARGUS architectural pattern** — integrating its hybrid pipeline concept and dataset configuration structure — while maintaining our existing document extraction and LLM orchestration frameworks.

Specifically:

1. **Adopt**

   * ARGUS’s **hybrid extraction + reasoning pipeline** (Document Intelligence + LLM reasoning).
   * The **dataset abstraction** for configurable prompts, schemas, and evaluation logic.
   * The **evaluation framework** for semantic and fuzzy string similarity validation.

2. **Not Adopt**

   * Direct usage of ARGUS source code for production workloads (due to limited enterprise support and extensibility constraints).
   * Its orchestration layer; instead, use our internal agentic workflow controller (LangGraph-based) for modular reasoning and observability.
   * Its storage and deployment model; integrate outputs directly into our existing Azure Cognitive Search and observability stack.

## **Rationale**

| **Capability Area**                | **Baseline (Doc Intelligence + LLM)** | **ARGUS Approach**                            | **Improvement**                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extraction Accuracy**            | High for structured fields only       | Combines layout parsing with reasoning        | Improved relational accuracy (e.g., linking totals, clauses, entities) |
| **Contextual Understanding**       | Limited to prompt quality             | Context-aware extraction and reasoning        | Stronger semantic linking between document sections                    |
| **Adaptability to Document Types** | Requires prompt tuning                | Dataset-based configuration (zero-shot)       | Lower maintenance; easier scaling across domains                       |
| **Evaluation & Traceability**      | Manual validation                     | Built-in semantic and fuzzy match evaluation  | Quantifiable quality metrics                                           |
| **Operational Scalability**        | Custom scripts per pipeline           | Cloud-native, event-driven model              | Aligns with current Service Bus event framework                        |
| **Governance / Auditability**      | Basic metadata logging                | Schema-based lineage with source traceability | Supports regulatory and audit trail requirements                       |

ARGUS’s hybrid design enables richer context understanding by reasoning over structured outputs, rather than raw text, allowing for domain-specific, traceable, and evaluatable document intelligence.
For our platform, this approach aligns with goals around **traceability, adaptive learning, and agentic human-in-the-loop review**.

## **Consequences**

### **Positive Impacts**

* **Improved data retrieval precision:** Context-aware extraction yields higher semantic accuracy.
* **Configurable and domain-specific:** Dataset abstraction supports different document categories (e.g., contracts, regulations, statements).
* **Enhanced traceability:** Ability to link extracted values to original document sources (page/section).
* **Quality monitoring:** Integrated evaluation module supports continuous accuracy measurement.
* **Alignment with agentic design:** Works synergistically with LangGraph and feedback loops.

### **Negative Impacts / Risks**

* **Increased computational cost:** Dual-stage processing (OCR + LLM reasoning) increases latency and Azure consumption.
* **Prompt governance overhead:** Multiple datasets require version control and approval workflows.
* **Code maturity:** ARGUS remains an open-source sample, not a production-ready framework.
* **Integration complexity:** Requires adaptation to existing observability, monitoring, and vector indexing systems.

---

## **Decision Outcome**

✅ **Approved for pilot integration** within the **Data Retrieval and Intelligence layer**.
A proof-of-concept will be implemented to benchmark:

* Extraction accuracy vs. baseline (precision, recall, F1)
* Contextual Q&A quality (semantic similarity scoring)
* Processing throughput and cost metrics

Based on pilot results, ARGUS’s design will inform the **final production blueprint** for contextual document understanding across regulatory, contractual, and financial document pipelines.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Deploy a controlled ARGUS-inspired pipeline for 200 sample documents.
2. Compare retrieval metrics against current Doc Intelligence + OpenAI baseline.
3. Document governance standards for dataset schema management.
4. Integrate evaluation outputs into the central observability dashboard.
5. Submit final implementation ADR following pilot outcome.

Would you like me to create a **companion technical architecture diagram (C4 Level-2 or Level-3)** showing where ARGUS fits in your existing document processing and agentic workflow stack? That would make this ADR complete for architecture board review.
