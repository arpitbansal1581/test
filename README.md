**Optimize Prompts for OpenAI** - Use Case: Suggest prompt templates for OpenAI APIs.
Example: Start writing a prompt design function, and Copilot can help craft concise, effective prompts.

**Learn New Libraries or Techniques** Use Case: Discover how to use unfamiliar Python libraries.
Example: If you're exploring asyncio or other libraries, Copilot can suggest usage patterns and examples.

**Generate Boilerplate Code** - code for common components (e.g., API requests, data preprocessing, or utility functions)
Function to send a request to OpenAI API and let Copilot generate the function for you.

**Accelerate Prototyping** -  prototypes faster by generating basic implementations of usecase like workflows.

**Automate Repetitive Tasks** - Use Case: Save time on repetitive tasks like handling configurations, or parsing JSON responses.
Example: When working with OpenAI API responses, Copilot can auto-generate parsing code for nested JSON objects.

**Write Tests Quickly** - Use Case: Generate unit tests or integration tests.
Example: Comment # Write a unit test for this function, and Copilot will suggest test cases using unittest or pytest.

**Improve Documentation** Use Case: Generate docstrings for your functions and classes to ensure better maintainability.
Example:after a function declaration, and Copilot can suggest a detailed docstring based on the code.

**Code Review Enhancements** - Use Case: Provide alternate approaches or cleaner implementations.
Example: Paste a function, and Copilot may suggest more efficient ways to write it.
